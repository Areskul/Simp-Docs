# Getting Started

## Install

Install it with yarn

```bash
yarn add -D simpcicd
```

or with npm

```bash
npm install -save-dev simpcicd
```

## Usage

Once you have set your config, it comes in 2 flavors:

- CLI
- usual module

### Cli

For short

```bash
simp -p <pipeline name>
```

will trigger a pipeline execution

```bash
simp hooks
```

will transform your pipelines in git hooks

```bash
simp hooks --delete
```

Will delete hooks generated by Simp CICD

### Config

Everithing fits in a config file.

Here is a simple example of what could contain simp.config.json

```json
pipeline : {
  name: "test",
  steps: [
    {
      name: "build",
      commands: ["yarn install", "yarn build"]
    },
  ],
  trigger: {
    branch: [
      "master",
      "dev"
    ]
  }
}
```

It becomes interesting when you use Typescript.

### Module

Their we are. You're gonna enjoy this part.
